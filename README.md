Omega - Interactive Sentences - version 2

1. Install java jdk, version 25, I have been using:
    openjdk version "25" 2025-09-16
    OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 25+36-3489)
    OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 25+36-3489, mixed mode, sharing)
1. Install omega assets content in runtim/omega_assets
1. Execute: ./buildAll
1. Execute: ./run

The provided gradlew wrapper should suffice when building the app. For developing I strongly recomend IntelliJ Idea.
